# Cryptography Accelerator v2

This is a cryptography accelerator chip for the GF180  PW0 tapeout. It includes an AES256 core (with some key-entropy restrictions), a SHA256 core, and some other experimental structures. This includes improved versions of unsuccessful cores from MPW-ONE.

For documentation on the AES and SHA cores (including the original Chisel source code), see [asinghani/crypto-accelerator](https://github.com/asinghani/crypto-accelerator)
